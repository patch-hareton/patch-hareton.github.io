            I value equality- safety and dignity for all sentient life. I
            value autonomy/expression - the ability to live independently
            with creativity and freedom. I value connection/friendship/love
            - sharing meaningful experiences, being recognised by others and
            recognising them. I value personal (and collective) growth, the
            ability to explore the world and stay curious.

            Working at Te Papa was a challenging experience, as my coworkers
            and especially those working at a lower level than me were treated
            extremely poorly by the managers. As someone who has been mistreated
            by a lot of employers before, I’m passionate about workers’ rights,
            and also understood that as a supervisor I had more ability and
            responsibility to speak up for people who were less capable/confident
            in speaking up for themselves. As such I became the workplace Marxist
            and had frequent tensions with higher-ups in the company, but it was
            important to me to know I was using my skills and energy to help people
            who were being treated unfairly by their employer.

            I can’t really think of what “my culture” would be, because I’ve lived
            on the edges of a lot of different ones. The culture I grew up in was
            extremely oppressive, and I guess I formed my values and identity in
            rebellion of that. Since then I’ve found people and communities that
            are more aligned with my values and have helped me strengthen and develop
            my sense of self and the world.

            I would identify some of my strengths as thoughtfulness,
            self-awareness, empathy and resilience. Some of my
            limitations are struggling with emotional balance,
            confusion, and maintaining passion for/commitment to things.
        </p>

            I think the last of these in particular is why I’ve struggled
            with learning things deeply and succeeding in a typical sense
            in any career. I have curiosity for a lot of things, but tell
            myself it isn’t worth engaging if I’m not totally passionate
            about them. As for career, I often get bored of what I’m doing
            and what I’m living, and start to daydream about other
            possibilities, rather than committing to the life I’ve already
            started building.

            I think at 28 I’m pretty self-aware, and I can approach a
            challenge like DevAcademy with a bit more patience and grace,
            knowing the ways in which my mind will try to trip me up and
            having strategies to overcome those challenges.

            I completed an Acting degree when I was a teenager, and a lot
            of the focus over the 3 years was artistic and academic
            collaboration. We had a lot of clashes as a class over the years,
            but we got better at communicating clearly and diplomatically
            and making compromises so that every person felt respected and
            supported. It helped having multiple people in the same situation,
            so that whenever there was a clash there were other people to rely
            on for support. We also understood that these conflicts were just
            part of collaborating on something we were all so passionate about,
            and that we all wanted the same thing for each other. Even though
            I did get a little better over the course, I could be quite fiery
            and undiplomatic in my approach to tension/conflict, and I think
            this is an area where I’ve grown a lot since.
