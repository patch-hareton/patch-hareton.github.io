    <h1>IQ & EQ</h1>
    <span>
        <p>
            IQ (Intelligence Quotient) is a term that refers to someone’s
            ability to absorb and retain information and logic,  and to access
            and use these for sound reasoning. It’s a somewhat nebulous term,
            and our cultural fixation with it (and the methods of testing it) 
            has been more than a little problematic. Although a lot of qualities
            that fall under the concept of ‘intelligence’ are of course extremely
            helpful in certain scenarios, as a society we’ve been neglecting
            Emotional Intelligence.

            Emotional intelligence (sometimes presented as EQ) is a term that’s
            been gaining popularity in recent years. It refers to people’s
            self-awareness, thoughtfulness, emotional regulation, and their
            attentiveness and empathy towards others. Importantly, it isn’t
            pre-determined, and can be developed and trained at any age. There
            are a lot of ways to cultivate EQ, including but not limited to
            meditation, therapy, travel, solitude, personal research and life
            experience.

            For me, I feel I developed some of my emotional intelligence from
            various chaotic situations in my life, including living in different
            countries and social dynamics, and having the time and solitude
            to process and reflect on these experiences.

            I don’t especially value my EQ in a solely professional light (though
            if it increases career possibilities, and especially if it makes the
            work lives of my colleagues less stressful, then that’s cool), so much
            as I’m just grateful for how it’s helped me exist in my own life and 
            navigate interactions with others and the world. Obviously I still
            have a lot more growing to do (and bragging about one’s own emotional
            intelligence isn’t super emotionally intelligent behaviour), but I’m
            passionate about the way EQ can benefit me and those around me.
