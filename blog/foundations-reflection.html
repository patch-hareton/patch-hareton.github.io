    <h1>Core Reflection</h1>
    <span>
        <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>

        <p>
            I’ve learned that the way you view challenging moments is an important factor in learning and working. I’ve learned that even though I might know a lot about principles like neuroplasticity and growth mindset intellectually, emotionally I still fall into those old habits/traps of getting stressed out and feeling not good enough when I encounter a challenging task. But I think the more I learn the more capable I am of seeing those moments slightly from an observer perspective; getting less sucked into the negative self-talk and viewing those moments as opportunities for growth.
        </p>

        <h3>What are the roles of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>

        <p>
            Tech is a powerful tool in the modern world, and it’s important that those engaging with it/creating infrastructure for it are doing so with moral intentions. On an individual level, knowing your values can motivate your learning and work (especially in more challenging moments), and empathy and self-awareness can improve your co-learning and co-working and make everyone’s study/work lives more harmonious.
        </p>

        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>

        <p>
            I find that divide between knowing something intellectually and knowing it emotionally super interesting. I guess it’s a lifelong journey to retrain our brains with a more hopeful and patient sense of neuroplasticity.
        </p>

        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>

        <p>
            I think it’s interesting studying core skills because sometimes I feel like they’re skills that are better developed from experience than research (eg. learning about emotional intelligence from an intellectual perspective). But actually I think it’s useful to research core skills alongside trying to develop/apply them in your real life. There were some moments where doing the core work felt easier (and perhaps less important) than working on tech stuff, but mostly I appreciated both.
        </p>

        <h3>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>

        <p>
            I think core skills are so important for so many aspects of life, so it’s great for any kind of course to pay some attention to them. But I guess it’s especially relevant because the course is an intense learning experience, and it’s useful to have the self-knowledge/emotional resources to make that intensity more fulfilling and slightly less stressful. Also because a bunch of companies in the tech industry value core skills in their hiring process perhaps more than other industries.
        </p>

        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>

        <p> 
            I think I sometimes felt that way, when I felt like I’d been struggling with tech but that core learning was a distraction of some sort. But actually it was good, not only to have other work to do when I felt like I needed a little break from the tech work, but also (& especially) because aspects of the core work (learning about neuroplasticity, mindfulness) are exactly the right things to remind myself of when I’m feeling stuck and uncertain with the tech work. So I think the two parts complement each other well.
