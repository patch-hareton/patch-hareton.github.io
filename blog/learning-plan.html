        <h3>bootcamp learning plan:</h3>
        
        <p>
            I still don’t have a clear plan for what I’d like to do after completing bootcamp. But I’m fascinated in being more involved in the tech world as it expands, and especially looking for ways that I could work with tech in a way that aligns with my values. Having worked as a video game tester before I’d love to try some video game dev work. But I’m also keen to look for opportunities to use tech in a more *political* way (eg. ways to respond to the climate emergency and wealth inequality). I guess I’m keen to learn as much as possible/get a good base knowledge of coding, but keep my career options/goals flexible. I’m also excited about developing skills that aren’t necessarily tech-specific, like focus, commitment, communication and other soft skills.
        </p>

        <p>
            Throughout Foundations I bumped up against a lot of the limitations I’d anticipated at the start. Sometimes, though, I surprised myself by how patient and compassionate I could be with myself when I was struggling with learning (especially compared to previous attempts to teach myself coding) - this was a cool thing to notice. But at other times I still became easily frustrated and overwhelmed. There were also moments when I didn’t feel frustrated with the work, but just kind of unenthusiastic about it, which was also an interesting challenge to learn how to push through those moments. I think these challenges, especially feeling upset and overwhelmed, will be things that come up a lot in Bootcamp. But I know I have the resources to get through those moments; I think I did a decent job of taking care of myself throughout Foundations, & I’m committed to doing the same throughout Bootcamp. I also think it will help me having other people to work/communicate with, and I want to be equally helpful to those around me, especially if they’re going through a rough patch with their learning.
        </p>

        <p>
            Continuing on from that, I’m a little anxious about my ability to commit to Bootcamp, and to stay focussed and inspired throughout. Realistically I know I won’t feel focussed and inspired every day for 9 weeks, so I’m keen to do my best to at least stay patient, and to further develop strategies to recover my commitment if/when some days are especially tough.
        </p>

        <p>
            My hope for myself at Dev Academy is that I gain a greater sense of commitment and confidence in myself, in my ability to learn, to solve problems, to carry myself gracefully through challenging moments, and to communicate and work well with others.
        </p>

        <p>
            I think the support I’ll likely need from the Bootcamp team is the same as I wanted & received from the Foundations team, which was reassurance that I was keeping up with the course okay, and that the technical and emotional obstacles I came up against weren’t signs that I wasn’t good enough to work in tech. I’m hoping over time I’ll get better at giving this support to myself, but I’m also anticipating that some moments of Bootcamp will test me pretty hard, so I’m looking forward to having a support network around me. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Throughout Foundations I tried to improve my focus and time management skills- sometimes I think I did this well and sometimes I think I let myself down a little. I’m committed to trying to step up more to Bootcamp, especially because I know the workload will require it. I have a lot of resources to support myself over the period, both inside and outside of the course, and I’m going to try to stay conscious of that and reach out before I get too overwhelmed. I want to stay aware of how I’m doing psychologically, and how I can meet the expectations of the work and still take care of myself. I also want to be a positive presence for those around me, and be available to support my cohort-mates both technically and personally if they need help. I know it’s going to be an intense experience for all of us, and I’m excited to do my best to make it a cool kind of intensity that we can all grow from.

        <p>
            I thought by this point I would have long-term goals and
            a career pathway, but I still don’t really. I’m passionate 
            about minimising the damage from wealth inequality
            and the climate emergency, and I’m keen to develop
            as many skills as I can to find ways to assist in
            new systems and technology to do so. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Since graduating school and college I’ve found that
            learning things has become increasingly difficult,
            as I’ve become less focussed and less confident in my
            ability to push through challenges. One of my main
            reasons for signing up to Dev Acad and my main hope
            is that it will build my focus and restore a sense
            of my own ability when it comes to learning. I hope
            that the course helps me develop a sense of patience
            and self-confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m looking forward to working with others as I think
            this will help me feel more committed knowing that
            others are relying on me and I can rely on them. I’m
            committed to communicating thoughtfully and respectfully
            with the other kids.
            But I’m also determined to improve my own self-learning/working
            abilities, and get better at strategies to recover and
            return to projects when I start to feel overwhelmed and
            inadequate. I also want to get better at asking for help
            when I need it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think the main thing I want from the facilitation
            team is just reassurance that I’m not totally fucking
            up, and maybe some guidance as to how I could more
            successfully execute my projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have therapy once a week which is pretty important, but
            I can negotiate a consistent time for this to fit with
            bootcamp.
