    <h1>my learning plan &#128218</h1>

        <p>
            I thought by this point I would have long-term goals and
            a career pathway, but I still don’t really. I’m passionate 
            about minimising the damage from wealth inequality
            and the climate emergency, and I’m keen to develop
            as many skills as I can to find ways to assist in
            new systems and and technology to do so. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Since graduating school and college I’ve found that
            learning things has become increasingly difficult,
            as I’ve become less focussed and less confident in my
            ability to push through challenges. One of my main
            reasons for signing up to Dev Acad and my main hope
            is that it will build my focus and restore a sense
            of my own ability when it comes to learning. I hope
            that the course helps me develop a sense of patience
            and self-confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m looking forward to working with others as I think
            this will help me feel more committed knowing that
            others are relying on me and I can rely on them. I’m
            committed to communicating thoughtfully and respectfully
            with the other kids.
            But I’m also determined to improve my own self-learning/working
            abilities, and get better at strategies to recover and
            return to projects when I start to feel overwhelmed and
            inadequate. I also want to get better at asking for help
            when I need it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think the main thing I want from the facilitation
            team is just reassurance that I’m not totally fucking
            up, and maybe some guidance as to how I could more
            successfully execute my projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have therapy once a week which is pretty important, but
            I can negotiate a consistent time for this to fit with
            bootcamp. 
        </p>
