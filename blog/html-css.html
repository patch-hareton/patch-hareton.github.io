    <h2>block, inline & inline-block displays</h2>
    <span>
        <p>
            There are a number of display properties
            that can be utilised with CSS to structure
            your webpage the way you want. Three important
            ones to know are display: block, display: inline,
            and display: inline-block.
        </p>
    </span>
    <img class="display" src=images/display-block.png title="display: block" alt="display: block"></img>
    <span>
        <p>
            The block display is by default 100% width, meaning
            it will stretch the full length of the page even
            if there isn’t enough content to fill it. Even by
            manually changing the width, blocks will always stack
            on top of each other - forcing other content to move
            above or below the block. p tags & div tags operate as
            blocks by default. Block display is useful
            when we want content to neatly claim a line on our
            page, but sometimes we want elements to share a line.
        </p>
    </span>
    <img class="display" src=images/display-inline.png title="display: inline" alt="display: inline"></img>
    <span>
        <p>
            The inline display means the element will only take
            up the width of the content itself, and allows multiple
            elements to appear along the same line. The width and
            height of the element can’t be changed. span tags
            operate as inline.
        </p>
    </span>
    <img class="display" src=images/display-inline-block.png title="display: inline-block" alt="display: inline-block"></img>
    <span>
        <p>
            As the name suggests, the inline-block display 
            is the best of both worlds. It allows you to adjust
            height & width/use padding without it interfering
            with/obscuring other content. Like block it still allows
            you to change its physical features, and like inline
            it still respects the other content around it.
        </p>
