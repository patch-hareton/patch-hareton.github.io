        <span>I value equality- safety and dignity for all sentient life.</span> 
        <span> I value autonomy/expression - the ability to live</span>
        <span> independently with creativity and freedom.</span>
        <span> I value connection/friendship/love - </span>
        <span>sharing meaningful experiences, being recognised by others</span>
        <span> and recognising them. I value personal (and collective) growth,</span>
        <span> the ability to explore the world and stay curious.</span>

        Working at Te Papa was a challenging experience,
        as my coworkers and especially those working at a
        lower level than me were treated extremely poorly
        by the managers. As someone who has been mistreated
        by a lot of employers before, and someone who reads
        a lot of Marxist theory, I’m passionate about workers’
        rights, and also understood that as a supervisor I had
        more ability and responsibility to speak up for people
        who were less capable/confident in speaking up for
        themselves. As such I became the workplace Marxist and
        had frequent tensions with higher-ups in the company,
        but it was important to me to know I was using my skills
        and energy to help people who were being treated unfairly
        by their employer.

        I can’t really think of what “my culture” would be, because
        I’ve lived on the edges of a lot of different ones. The culture
        I grew up in was extremely oppressive, and I guess I formed my 
        alues and identity in rebellion of that. Since then I’ve found
        people and communities that are more in line with my values and
        have helped me strengthen and develop my sense of self and the world.
