    <h1>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</h1>

        <h3>Neuroplasticity:</h3>
        <p>
            Neuroplasticity is the science-backed reality that our brains are malleable, and that by changing our behaviours we can change our thought patterns and vice versa. Brains, like other muscles, change depending on how we use them (ie. they are more plastic than they are set in stone).  As described by Johann Hari, “Your brain is constantly changing to meet your needs. It does this mainly in two ways: by pruning the synapses you don’t use, and by growing the synapses you do use.”

            There are many ways to increase your neuroplasticity. Many forms of therapy rely on the concept, that by thinking differently and acting differently, we’ll start to feel different. Just knowing about neuroplasticity can have a huge affect on people, and give them more confidence in their own ability to change and grow.

            Psychologists are careful not to overstate the power of neuroplasticity, and to acknowledge that some aspects of our brains and bodies are less malleable than others. Norman Doidge, a leading scientist and writer on the subject, says we aught to be cautious not to advocate for what he calls ‘neurological utopianism’, but that a deeper understanding of neuroplasticity can help lift us out of our current cultural neurological nihilism. “As I see it, false hope & false despair are twin brothers, each vying to do harm.”

            “I think the word ‘cure’ is a very ambitious word. Often what we see is something much less sensational, something much less dramatic, that ultimately takes place over a long period of time. I think we do have to be careful not to overstate our claims, in general: I think we damage the integrity of our research if we appear to give people false hope. The other thing I think is worth mentioning is that, often when people have an illness or are experiencing disability, there’s an element of that where they need to learn to live with limitations, to learn to live with their new condition. But it’s very important as well, I think, to be mindful of whether those limitations are real, or whether they’re imposed by society.” - Dan Reisel

        <h3>Growth Mindset:</h3>
        <p>
            The term Growth Mindset was coined by Carol Dweck, a professor of psychology at Stanford, in the 1970s. A growth mindset is one where people believe they can grow and improve through difficulty, as opposed to believing if they can’t do something now then they’ll never be able to do it (fixed mindset). It’s having confidence in your own ability to grow and improve, and seeing challenges as opportunities rather than a sign you’re failing or incapable.
	        A growth mindset is relevant to learning because it helps you maximise potential and overcome burnout/feelings of inadequacy.

        <h3>My journey:</h3>
        <p>
            Like a lot of people, I inherited a belief early in my life that certain elements (if not the entirety) of my psychology and personality were indelible. In high school I bought into the dichotomy that there were people suited to arts and people suited to math & science, and that if I was the former I had no capacity for the latter. This is one of the beliefs that has caused me to postpone my tech journey for a long time.

            Another big obstacle for me has been depression. Psychologists often describe depression as a narrowing of perspective, an inability to imagine change and growth. In his book <em>Lost Connections</em>, Johann Hari writes about how our cultural beliefs about psychology and psychiatry reinforce conditions like depression, and how a knowledge of neuroplasticity is an essential resource in lifting people out of these locked mindsets and towards better health.

            Neuroplasticity and growth mindset were principles I already knew about, but researching them for the course has made me even more excited to try to develop a growth mindset and reorient my brain towards more fulfilling thought patterns & behaviours. I’m still a little scared and pessimistic about my ability to change my brain (super fucking ironic) but I’m looking forward to the opportunity to try to build it. I’m going to do this by reminding myself of the principles, being patient and compassionate with myself when I’m struggling and remind myself of the potential for growth (both short-term and long-term) in those more challenging moments.
