        <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
        <p>
            Pseudocode is the practice of writing comments above/between your code, as a way of orienting yourself towards what you’re trying to build with your code. Pseudocode is a great way to plan how you’re going to approach a challenge, and also useful if you get stuck and need to break down what you’re trying to do in plain English. I’ve used pseudocode a few times this week in the katas to keep simple instructions visible/close to my code, so if anything isn’t working I can easily remind myself what I’m aiming for.

        <h3>Trying something</h3>
        <p>
            Sometimes it’s good to just try different things, even if you’re not totally certain what the solution is or even what your strategy is. It’s better than just staying stuck, and you might learn something even from options that don’t work. Often when I’ve started a challenge and only read it once or twice, I’m still a little vague about exactly what I’m aiming for and how I could get there. But I’ve written down a few ideas of code that might be useful and tried various combinations, commenting and uncommenting to see if anything brings me closer to the goal, and if it doesn’t then noticing what it does instead.

        <h3>Rubber Ducky method</h3>
        <p>
            The Rubber Ducky method is the process of speaking aloud what the challenge is and what the problem is you’ve encountered along the way. Often in explaining the situation in careful detail, whether to someone else, to a rubber ducky, or to ourselves, we realise exactly what we’ve gotten stuck on, and how to get unstuck. I don’t have any rubber ducks in my apartment but I do talk to myself semi-regularly while coding (sorry housemates), especially when I’m uncertain of something, and sometimes doing so has helped me realise the way forward.

    <span>
        <h3>Error messages</h3>
        <p>
            Lots of coding tools provide error messages when something has gone wrong. Rather than just getting frustrated that your code hasn’t worked, seeing error messages as a resource is a useful problem-solving strategy. I’ve been working on getting better at this, getting over the sudden frustration that my code isn’t running smoothly and instead focussing on the information the error message is giving me, exactly what it wants me to do instead.

    <span>
        <h3>Console logging</h3>
        <p>
            Using console.log() is another helpful resource. Sometimes I’ve written some code that I thought would work, but didn’t, and it’s been valuable to use console.log() to check what my code would print and compare that to what I’m trying to achieve instead. Plus, sometimes you learn cool things that aren’t even connected to the current challenge.

        <h3>Googling</h3>
        <p>
            Non-gender-specific person’s best friend. Sometimes I’ll know exactly what I need to code, but I need a refresher on the specific syntax, so I have a quick check on google. Other times I’ll try working something out for a while, and if I really feel stuck, I’ll do some more research on tech blogs/forums. YouTube has also been a great ally, and it helps expand my knowledge of JavaScript.

        <h3>Asking your peers and coaches for help</h3>
        <p>
            Sometimes you’ve been stuck on a problem for so long that you realise you’re going to need a bit more guidance to get through it. It’s been awesome having the support of my cohort-mates and my facilitator. The deeper into my DevAcad journey I go the more comfortable I feel reaching out when I have really hit a wall on something. It’s been great to get hints/tips on how to tweak my code, or a different angle on how to approach the problem, or even just the solidarity of someone confirming that I’m not dumb for being stuck we’re I am, and that I’m potentially not that far off of working it out, I just need maybe a little encouragement and help.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            Reflection is a great way to contextualise your learning and your process. It helps me remind myself of the effort that I’m putting into the work, and also remember that challenges that seemed intensely frustrating at the time I got through in the end. Which can help me feel more confident in my ability and less insecure the next time I come up against a problem.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <span>
        <p>
            Last week especially there was a lot to learn, then a lot of challenges to put that learning into practice. I’ve encountered a lot of problems, some easy to overcome and others that took a lot more time & further learning. As well as different combinations of the techniques listed above,  I’ve tried paying close attention to the headspace I’m in, how I’m feeling, trying to look at the problem from a different angle, or maybe spend some time on a different challenge/exercise that feels less intimidating at the moment, or taking a break altogether if I need and coming back with a fresh mind. I wasn’t always successful in responding to these hurdles gracefully and not feeling panicked and insecure in my ability, but I trust that the more I practice both coding and all the problem solving strategies I have available, the less uncomfortable I’ll feel when I inevitably get tripped up again in the future.
