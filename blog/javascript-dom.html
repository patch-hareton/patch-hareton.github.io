    <h2>JavaScript & the DOM</h2>
    <span>
        <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>
            Two of the main pillars of a webpage are HTML and CSS. HTML
            (HyperText Markup Language) arranges and prints the actual
            content of a webpage, like the text, images, links etc.. We
            could make a webpage with only HTML, and it would be functional,
            it just might not be super easy or enjoyable to read. CSS
            (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to modify the aesthetics of the
            content we’ve provided with HTML, and ultimately make our webpage
            both more visually pleasing and accessible. With CSS we can
            change the font and size of text, we can add colours and borders,
            change the size of photos, and many more tricks. You could think
            of HTML as the screenwriter of a film, and CSS as the artistic
            director. CSS needs HTML to give them something interesting to play
            with, HTML's work is kind of boring without the artistic flair of CSS.

        <h3>Control Flow</h3>
        <p>
            By default, JavaScript code executes from top to bottom, line by line.
            But control flow is an exception to this (ie. it <em>controls the flow</em> 
            of our code). Control flow allows us to use features such as loops and
            conditional statements to take our code in different directions. A loop 
            is a feature that cycles (loops) through a piece of code until the set 
            conditions are met. It’s sort of like looking out the window multiple times
            on a cloudy day, until you see a glimmer of sunshine, and know it’s the right
            time to go for a walk.
        </p>

    <span>
        <h3>The DOM</h3>
        <p>
            The DOM (Document Object Model) is the structure combining HTML, CSS &
            JavaScript to make sense of everything going on within a webpage. Using
            Developer Tools we can access the DOM, and both find important information
            and make changes. For instance, by looking at another website’s DOM we can
            better understand how it was put together, and from that learn how to put
            together a new webpage of our own. Or we could test new HTML, CSS and JavaScript
            ideas on the webpage’s DOM to see what cool changes we could make.

        <h3>Arrays & Objects</h3>
        <p>
            There are multiple different ways of storing data in JavaScript, but two of
            the most common are arrays and objects. An array is a list of various pieces
            of data, usually in quotation marks (ie. strings) unless they are number values.
            The items stored in an array each have an index position (starting at 0), which can
            be used if we are looking for a specific item in the array.
            
            An object can provide multiple pieces of information about something, as it
            separates data into key-value pairs. We can call the entire object if we want
            to see all the data inside it, or we can specify which key(s) we want to see
            the value of.
        </p>
    </span>
    <span>
        <h3>Functions</h3>
        <p>Functions are a great way for us to give instructions to our code. Not only can
            we create them to access and display certain information from variables we’ve
            created, we can build complex functions that execute other functions inside of
            them for the desired result.
